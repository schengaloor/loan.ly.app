## 📌 Problem Overview

In many low-income and rural areas, individuals are excluded from formal credit systems due to a lack of credit history, collateral, and accessible banking infrastructure. During emergencies, these individuals are often forced to rely on high-interest informal loans or predatory lenders. Traditional financial institutions are slow, opaque, and inaccessible to those who need them most.
